## Waterfall Methodology 

### Definition

**Waterfall methodology** is a **traditional SDLC model** in which software development is carried out in a **linear and sequential manner**.
Each phase must be **completed fully before moving to the next phase**, and there is **no overlap between phases**.

It is called *Waterfall* because progress flows **downward like a waterfall** from one phase to another.

### 1. Requirement Analysis

* Complete and detailed requirements are gathered from the customer
* Requirements are clearly documented and frozen
  **Output:** Software Requirement Specification (SRS)

---

### 2. System Design

* Overall system architecture is created
* Hardware, software, database, and interface design are defined
  **Output:** Design documents (HLD and LLD)

---

### 3. Implementation (Development)

* Actual coding of the system starts
* Each module is developed based on the design
  **Output:** Source code

---

### 4. Testing

* Integrated system is tested for defects
* Ensures the software meets the specified requirements
  **Output:** Tested software

---

### 5. Deployment

* Software is delivered and installed in the user environment
* End users start using the system
  **Output:** Operational system

---

### 6. Maintenance

* Bug fixes, updates, and enhancements are performed
* System is maintained after delivery
  **Output:** Updated software versions

---

## Key Characteristics of Waterfall Model

* Linear and sequential process
* Each phase has clearly defined deliverables
* Easy to understand and manage
* Changes are difficult once a phase is completed

---

## Advantages

* Simple and easy to understand
* Clear documentation at each stage
* Suitable for small and well-defined projects
* Easy project tracking and management

---

## Disadvantages

* Not flexible to changing requirements
* Late testing increases risk
* Working software is delivered very late
* Not suitable for complex or long-term projects

---

## When to Use Waterfall Methodology

* Requirements are clear and stable
* Technology is well understood
* Project scope is fixed
* Short-duration projects

---

### One-Line Summary

> **Waterfall methodology is a linear SDLC model where each phase is completed one after another with no overlap.**
