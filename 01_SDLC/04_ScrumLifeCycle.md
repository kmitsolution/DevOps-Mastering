## Scrum Lifecycle – Step-by-Step Explanation

**Scrum** is an **Agile framework** used to develop software through **short, time-boxed iterations** called *sprints*.
The Scrum lifecycle shows how work flows from an **idea** to a **potentially shippable product increment** in a continuous loop.

## Step 1: Product Backlog Creation

* A **Product Backlog** is created by the **Product Owner**
* It contains a prioritized list of:

  * Features
  * Enhancements
  * Bug fixes
* Each item is called a **Product Backlog Item (PBI)** or **User Story**

**Output:** Ordered Product Backlog

---

## Step 2: Sprint Planning

* Team selects items from the Product Backlog for the next sprint
* Sprint goal is defined
* Tasks are identified and estimated

**Key Questions Answered**

* What can be delivered in this sprint?
* How will the work be done?

**Output:** Sprint Backlog + Sprint Goal

---

## Step 3: Sprint Execution (Development)

* Sprint duration: **1–4 weeks** (commonly 2 weeks)
* Team designs, codes, and tests selected backlog items
* No changes allowed to sprint scope during the sprint

**Output:** Working product increment

---

## Step 4: Daily Scrum (Daily Stand-up)

* 15-minute daily meeting
* Each team member answers:

  1. What did I do yesterday?
  2. What will I do today?
  3. Are there any blockers?

**Purpose:** Transparency and quick issue resolution

---

## Step 5: Sprint Review

* Conducted at the end of the sprint
* Team demonstrates completed work to stakeholders
* Feedback is collected

**Output:** Updated Product Backlog

---

## Step 6: Sprint Retrospective

* Team reflects on the sprint
* Discusses:

  * What went well?
  * What didn’t go well?
  * How to improve?

**Output:** Action items for process improvement

---

## Step 7: Increment Release (Optional)

* The product increment is:

  * Potentially shippable
  * May be released immediately or later

**Output:** Released or ready-to-release product

---

## Step 8: Repeat the Cycle

* Next sprint begins immediately
* Backlog is refined continuously
* Cycle repeats until project goals are achieved

## Key Points to Remember

* Scrum is **iterative and incremental**
* Each sprint delivers working software
* Feedback drives continuous improvement
* Lifecycle repeats until product completion

### One-Line Summary

> **Scrum lifecycle is a repeating sprint-based process that delivers working software through planning, development, review, and improvement.**
