**Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a **systematic process** used to develop software in a **planned, structured, and disciplined way**.
It defines a sequence of phases that guide a software product from **initial idea to final deployment and ongoing maintenance**, ensuring quality, correctness, and manageability.

SDLC is **generic and methodology-independent** (can be applied to Waterfall, Agile, Spiral, etc.) and focuses on **what happens at each stage of software creation**, not on tools or roles.

## Phases of SDLC

### 1. **Requirement Analysis**

* Understanding what the user or customer needs
* Defining functional and non-functional requirements
  **Output:** Requirement specification document

---

### 2. **Design**

* Creating system architecture and detailed design
* Defining data flow, modules, interfaces, and databases
  **Output:** Design documents (HLD / LLD)

---

### 3. **Development**

* Writing the actual source code
* Converting design into a working program
  **Output:** Source code

---

### 4. **Testing**

* Verifying that the software works as expected
* Identifying and fixing defects
  **Output:** Tested and validated software

---

### 5. **Implementation (Deployment)**

* Installing the software in the user environment
* Making the system available for use
  **Output:** Live/installed software system

---

### 6. **Maintenance**

* Fixing bugs found after release
* Enhancing and updating the system over time
  **Output:** Improved and stable software

### One-Line Generic Definition

> **SDLC is a structured approach that defines the stages involved in developing software from requirements gathering to maintenance.**
