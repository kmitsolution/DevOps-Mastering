## Agile Methodology – Explanation

### What is Agile Methodology?

**Agile methodology** is an **iterative and incremental approach** to software development where the project is broken into **small, manageable units** called *iterations* or *sprints*.
Instead of delivering the entire software at the end, Agile focuses on **frequent delivery of working software**, continuous feedback, and adaptability to change.

Agile emphasizes:

* Customer collaboration
* Flexibility to changing requirements
* Continuous improvement
* Early and frequent delivery

## Agile Manifesto – Core Values

Agile is based on four key values:

1. Individuals and interactions **over** processes and tools
2. Working software **over** comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration **over** contract negotiation
4. Responding to change **over** following a plan

* Work is divided into short cycles (1–4 weeks)
* Each cycle delivers a usable product increment
* Feedback is taken after every cycle
* Requirements evolve over time

## Agile Implementation Frameworks / Methods

Agile is a **philosophy**, and it is implemented using different **frameworks and practices**.

---

## 1. Scrum

**Scrum** is the **most widely used Agile framework**.

### Key Features

* Work is done in fixed-length **sprints** (usually 2 weeks)
* Focus on teamwork and accountability

### Roles

* Product Owner
* Scrum Master
* Development Team

### Artifacts

* Product Backlog
* Sprint Backlog
* Increment

### Ceremonies

* Sprint Planning
* Daily Stand-up
* Sprint Review
* Sprint Retrospective

**Best suited for:** Projects with frequently changing requirements

---

## 2. Extreme Programming (XP)

**XP** focuses heavily on **engineering practices** to improve software quality.

### Key Practices

* Pair Programming
* Test-Driven Development (TDD)
* Continuous Integration
* Simple Design
* Frequent releases

**Best suited for:** Projects requiring high code quality and frequent changes

---

## 3. Kanban

**Kanban** is a **visual workflow management method**.

### Key Features

* Work visualized on a Kanban board
* Continuous delivery (no fixed sprints)
* Limits work in progress (WIP)

**Best suited for:** Maintenance and support projects

---

## 4. Lean Software Development

Derived from lean manufacturing principles.

### Principles

* Eliminate waste
* Deliver fast
* Build quality in
* Continuous improvement

**Best suited for:** Optimizing processes and efficiency

---

## 5. Crystal Methodology

* Focuses on **people and communication**
* Different versions based on team size (Crystal Clear, Crystal Orange)

**Best suited for:** Small to medium-sized teams

## Comparison of Agile Implementations

| Framework | Iterations       | Focus Area             | Best Use Case           |
| --------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Scrum     | Fixed (Sprints)  | Project management     | New feature development |
| XP        | Short iterations | Engineering practices  | High-quality code       |
| Kanban    | Continuous       | Workflow visualization | Support & maintenance   |
| Lean      | Continuous       | Efficiency             | Process optimization    |
| Crystal   | Iterative        | People-centric         | Small teams             |

---

## Advantages of Agile

* Adapts easily to change
* Early delivery of working software
* Better customer satisfaction
* Reduced risk

---

## Disadvantages of Agile

* Less documentation
* Requires strong collaboration
* Difficult to estimate cost and timeline initially
* Not ideal for fixed-scope projects

---

### One-Line Summary

> **Agile methodology is an iterative approach to software development that delivers working software frequently and adapts to change through continuous feedback.**
