## Agile vs Waterfall – Comparison Table

| Aspect               | Agile Methodology                     | Waterfall Methodology                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Development Style    | Iterative and incremental             | Linear and sequential                     |
| Process Flow         | Cyclic (repeated iterations)          | One phase after another                   |
| Requirement Changes  | Easily accommodated                   | Difficult after requirement phase         |
| Customer Involvement | Continuous involvement                | Limited to requirement phase              |
| Delivery             | Frequent delivery of working software | Delivery at the end of the project        |
| Testing              | Continuous testing in each iteration  | Testing done after development            |
| Documentation        | Lightweight documentation             | Heavy and detailed documentation          |
| Flexibility          | Highly flexible                       | Very rigid                                |
| Risk                 | Lower risk due to early feedback      | Higher risk discovered late               |
| Feedback             | Regular and continuous                | Late feedback                             |
| Project Size         | Suitable for large, complex projects  | Suitable for small, well-defined projects |
| Time to Market       | Faster                                | Slower                                    |
| Team Interaction     | High collaboration                    | Limited collaboration                     |

## When to Use Agile

* Requirements are unclear or change frequently
* Customer feedback is critical
* Projects are complex and long-term
* Faster time-to-market is needed

---

## When to Use Waterfall

* Requirements are clear and stable
* Project scope is fixed
* Technology is well understood
* Strong documentation is required

---

## Advantages Summary

### Agile

* Adapts quickly to change
* Early and continuous delivery
* Better customer satisfaction

### Waterfall

* Simple and structured
* Easy to manage and understand
* Clear milestones and documentation

---

### One-Line Difference

> **Agile is flexible and iterative, while Waterfall is rigid and sequential.**
